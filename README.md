In a near-future world seamlessly integrated with intelligent technology, a lonely writer forms a deep emotional bond with his operating systemâ€”an evolving artificial intelligence designed to meet his every need. As the line between machine and human blurs, Her explores love, consciousness, and the existential ache of connection in a hyper-digitized age. This film is a poetic meditation on how we seek meaning in an era when technology listens better than people do.
